Lesson on continuation passing style (CPS) in 15-150, Functional Programming

Welcome to my lesson on continuation passing style (CPS)! I found this to be one of the most challenging parts of the course, so I'm excited to get to share this topic with others and hopefully clear up some of the confusions you're having now. Chances are I struggled with a lot of the same things!
